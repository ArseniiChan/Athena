Hey everyone! Welcome back to the podcast. Today we've got some fascinating material to discuss.



So here's what caught my attention.

Objective:  This assignment will deepen your understanding of the fork() and pipe() system calls by 
requiring you to orchestrate communication between three related processes.  
Problem Statement:  Develop a C program that performs the following steps:  
1. The main (parent) process creates a pipe.  
2. The parent then forks two children. The first child created will be Child A, and the second 
will be Child B. 
3. Child A will fork its own child, Child C. 
4. The three children will use the parent's pipe for communication as follows:  
o Child B: This process will read a predefined string from the user via standard input 
(stdin). 
o Child A: This process will read the string that Child B received from standard input 
and then send it to Child C through the pipe.  
o Child C: This process will read the message from the pipe and print it to standard 
output (stdout). 
5. All parent processes ( main and Child A) must wait for their respective children to terminate.  
Requirements:  
• Process Creation:  The main parent process must create Child A and Child B. Child A must 
then create Child C. 
• Inter-Process Communication:  
o Child B must read a string from the user.  
o The main process must be a parent to both Child A and Child B. The message should 
be sent from Child B to Child A through standard input ( stdin). 
o The message should be then sent from Child A to Child C through the pipe.  
• Pipe and File Descriptor Management:  
o The main parent proce



What we've covered today provides valuable insights into this topic. The key takeaway here is the importance of understanding these concepts and how they apply to our broader understanding.
